<hr />

AALpy is a light-weight [automata learning](https://medium.com/p/82f7ec21d50d) library written in Python. 
You can start learning models of black-box systems with a few lines of code.

<!---
AALpy supports both **active** and **passive** automata learning algorithms that can be used to learn a variety of modeling formalisms, including 
**deterministic**, **non-deterministic**, and **stochastic automata**, as well as **deterministic context-free grammars/pushdown automata**.

AALpy also features a Generalized State Merging (GSM) framework based on the [Red-Blue method](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221523449_Results_of_the_Abbadingo_One_DFA_Learning_Competition_and_a_New_Evidence-Driven_State_Merging_Algorithm), which simplifies the implementation of more complex and extensible passive learning algorithms, such as EDSM, k-tails and likelihood-ratio.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the latest release of AALpy:
```bash
pip install aalpy
```
To install current version of the master branch (it might contain bugfixes and added functionalities between releases):
```bash
pip install https://github.com/DES-Lab/AALpy/archive/master.zip
```
The minimum required version of Python is 3.6.  
Ensure that you have [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) installed and added to your path if you want to visualize models.

For manual installation, clone the repo and install `pydot` (the only dependency).

## Documentation and Wiki

High level introduction to automata learning can be found at the following [Medium post](https://medium.com/p/82f7ec21d50d).
If you are interested in automata learning or would like to understand the automata learning process in more detail,
please check out our **Wiki**. On Wiki, you will find more detailed examples on how to use AALpy.
- <https://github.com/DES-Lab/AALpy/wiki>

***[Examples.py](https://github.com/DES-Lab/AALpy/blob/master/Examples.py)*** contains examples covering almost the whole of AALpy's functionality and its a great starting point. 

### Usage

All active automata learning procedures follow this high-level approach:
- [Define the input alphabet and system under learning (SUL)](https://github.com/DES-Lab/AALpy/wiki/SUL-Interface,-or-How-to-Learn-Your-Systems)
- [Choose the equivalence oracle](https://github.com/DES-Lab/AALpy/wiki/Equivalence-Oracles)
- [Run the learning algorithm](https://github.com/DES-Lab/AALpy/wiki/Setting-Up-Learning)

Passive learning algorithm simply require you to provide data in the appropriate format (check Wiki and Examples) and run the learning function.


<details>
  <summary>Code snipped demonstrating some of AALpy's functionalities</summary>

The following snippet demonstrates a short example in which an automaton is either [loaded](https://github.com/DES-Lab/AALpy/wiki/Loading,Saving,-Syntax-and-Visualization-of-Automata) or [randomly generated](https://github.com/DES-Lab/AALpy/wiki/Generation-of-Random-Automata) and then [learned](https://github.com/DES-Lab/AALpy/wiki/Setting-Up-Learning).
```python
from aalpy.utils import load_automaton_from_file, generate_random_deterministic_automata
from aalpy.SULs import AutomatonSUL
from aalpy.oracles import RandomWalkEqOracle
from aalpy.learning_algs import run_Lstar, run_KV

# load an automaton
# automaton = load_automaton_from_file('path_to_the_file.dot', automaton_type='dfa')

# or randomly generate one
random_dfa = generate_random_deterministic_automata(automaton_type='dfa', num_states=8, 
                                                    input_alphabet_size=5, output_alphabet_size=2)

# get input alphabet of the automaton
alphabet = random_dfa.get_input_alphabet()

# loaded or randomly generated automata are considered as BLACK-BOX that is queried
# learning algorithm has no knowledge about its structure
# create a SUL instance for the automaton/system under learning
sul = AutomatonSUL(random_dfa)

# define the equivalence oracle
eq_oracle = RandomWalkEqOracle(alphabet, sul, num_steps=5000, reset_prob=0.09)

# start learning
# run_KV is for the most part reacquires much fewer interactions with the system under learning
learned_dfa = run_KV(alphabet, sul, eq_oracle, automaton_type='dfa')
# or run L*
# learned_dfa_lstar = run_Lstar(alphabet, sul, eq_oracle, automaton_type='dfa')

# save automaton to file and visualize it
# save_automaton_to_file(learned_dfa, path='Learned_Automaton', file_type='dot')
# or
learned_dfa.save()

# visualize automaton
# visualize_automaton(learned_dfa)
learned_dfa.visualize()
# or just print its DOT representation
print(learned_dfa)
```
</details>

To make experiments reproducible, define a random seed at the beginning of your program.
```Python
from random import seed
seed(2) # all experiments will be reproducible
```
